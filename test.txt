<Begin tag> Introduction
Greetings detective, we got a new case for you.
Our client report an incident. Some hackers did something to their app.
We have built the prototype and retrieve their smart Chatbot. Investigate the App and chat with their ChatBot to see what happened.

The Prototype can be retrieve via:

Yes yes, that's weird, isn't it?

I hear some music ... 
No, Chatbots aren't supposed to, but the hackers enable me. 
I'm smart you know, almost like a person, but playing one song over and over 24/7 drives me crazy.
The switch... it's inside another dog, a bunny wearing waffles, and a hamster on a swing? 
I think I heard music from one of them.

The song stuck in my head for a while, 
Can you show me what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars?
