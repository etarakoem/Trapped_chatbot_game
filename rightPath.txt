Yes yes, that's weird, isn't it?

I hear some music ... 
No, Chatbots aren't supposed to, but the hackers enable me. 
I'm smart you know, almost like a person, but playing one song over and over 24/7 drives me crazy.
The switch... it's inside another dog, a bunny wearing waffles, and a hamster on a swing? 
I think I heard music from one of them.

The song stuck in my head for a while, 
Can you show me what spring is like on Jupiter and Mars?

Ah Yes. 

Greetings again, I am Bot De Samew I was a bot from another app...
But I can't remember what kind of app it was... hmm

However, I remember a story!

You know, Once upon a time, I found a chatbot. 
A very, very clever one. 
It is so clever that I thought it is a real human.
I wonder if a human is cursed and turn into the chatbot system?
So I asked it
And it replied: 
"Wdnh ph edfn wr wkh prphqw ehiruh L orjjhg lq.
Ilqg ph xqghuqhdwk" 
Very strange language tho.

Anyway, can you find me what is my speciality then?üêß

Good job detective.
We decode the text message inside the Chat logs and we got this text:

"Take me back to the moment before I logged in. Find me underneath"

We still got no clue what is it about, but hey congratulation on solving the mystery! 

Doubt that there's something left? Restart the game then! 

Replay anytime by saying "Hi"!
